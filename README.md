Introduction

The Facial Recognition and Emotion Detection System is an AI-powered application that identifies human faces and detects their emotions in real-time. It then responds with personalized messages based on the detected face and emotion. The system utilizes deep learning models for accurate predictions and can be applied in various fields such as human-computer interaction, security, and customer engagement.

Features

Face Recognition: Identifies and verifies individuals from images or real-time video.

Emotion Detection: Detects emotions such as happy, sad, neutral, angry, surprised, etc.

Real-time Processing: Uses a webcam or live feed for instant predictions.

Personalized Responses: Custom messages based on detected emotions.

Scalable: Can be integrated into various applications (security systems, smart assistants, etc.).

Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV – For real-time face detection

TensorFlow/Keras – Deep learning framework

Dlib – Face recognition library

Haar Cascades / MTCNN – For face detection

Emotion Recognition Model – Trained using CNNs

Flask (optional) – For building a web-based interface

Dataset

The project uses publicly available datasets such as:

FER-2013

CK+ Dataset

Custom dataset (optional) for improved accuracy

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-recognition-emotion-detection.git
cd facial-recognition-emotion-detection

Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Download pre-trained models (if available) or train your own.

Usage

Run the facial recognition and emotion detection script:

python main.py

For real-time detection, ensure a webcam is connected.

Adjust settings/configurations in config.py if needed.

Model Training

Prepare the dataset by organizing images into labeled folders.

Train the face recognition model using:

python train_face_recognition.py

Train the emotion detection model:

python train_emotion_model.py

Save trained models for deployment.

Results

Accuracy achieved: XX% (depends on trained model)

Real-time response time: X ms

Sample output:


Future Enhancements

Improve emotion detection accuracy with a larger dataset.

Implement a web-based dashboard for better visualization.

Integrate voice-based responses.

Optimize for edge devices like Raspberry Pi.
