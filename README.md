## Introduction
The **Facial Recognition and Emotion Detection System** is an AI-powered application that identifies human faces and detects their emotions in real-time. It then responds with personalized messages based on the detected face and emotion. The system utilizes deep learning models for accurate predictions and can be applied in various fields such as human-computer interaction, security, and customer engagement.

## Features
- **Face Recognition**: Identifies and verifies individuals from images or real-time video.
- **Emotion Detection**: Detects emotions such as happy, sad, neutral, angry, surprised, etc.
- **Real-time Processing**: Uses a webcam or live feed for instant predictions.
- **Personalized Responses**: Custom messages based on detected emotions.
- **Scalable**: Can be integrated into various applications (security systems, smart assistants, etc.).

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **OpenCV** – For real-time face detection
- **TensorFlow/Keras** – Deep learning framework
- **Dlib** – Face recognition library
- **Haar Cascades / MTCNN** – For face detection
- **Emotion Recognition Model** – Trained using CNNs
- **Flask** (optional) – For building a web-based interface

## Dataset
The project uses publicly available datasets such as:
- [FER-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)
- [CK+ Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deadskull7/fer2013)
- Custom dataset (optional) for improved accuracy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-recognition-emotion-detection.git
   cd facial-recognition-emotion-detection
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download pre-trained models (if available) or train your own.

## Usage
1. Run the facial recognition and emotion detection script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. For real-time detection, ensure a webcam is connected.
3. Adjust settings/configurations in `config.py` if needed.

## Model Training
1. Prepare the dataset by organizing images into labeled folders.
2. Train the face recognition model using:
   ```bash
   python train_face_recognition.py
   ```
3. Train the emotion detection model:
   ```bash
   python train_emotion_model.py
   ```
4. Save trained models for deployment.

## Results
- Accuracy achieved: **XX%** (depends on trained model)
- Real-time response time: **X ms**
- Sample output:
