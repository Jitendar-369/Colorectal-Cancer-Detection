# Colorectal Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based model for colorectal cancer detection and classification using the LC25000 dataset. The model predicts the presence of colorectal cancer and classifies its stages based on histopathological images.

## Dataset
- **Name:** LC25000 Dataset
- **Description:** Contains 25,000 labeled histopathological images of lung and colon cancer.
- **Classes:** 
  - Normal
  - Benign Tumor
  - Malignant Tumor
  
## Features
- **Preprocessing:** Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- **Model Architecture:** Deep learning-based CNN models (e.g., VGG, ResNet, or a custom CNN).
- **Training:** Using labeled images with validation and testing.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/colorectal-cancer-detection.git
cd colorectal-cancer-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the model training script:
```bash
python train.py
```
Run predictions on new images:
```bash
python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

## Results
- Model accuracy: **XX%**
- Precision: **XX%**
- Recall: **XX%**
- Confusion Matrix:

## Future Enhancements
- Improve accuracy with advanced architectures (e.g., Transformer-based models).
- Implement explainability techniques (Grad-CAM, SHAP).
- Deploy as a web app for real-time classification.
